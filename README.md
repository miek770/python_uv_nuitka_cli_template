# My Python CLI Project Template

This is a Python command line interface (CLI) project template that combines the following libraries:

- `black`: To automate formatting.
- `nuitka`: To compile the project for distribution.
- `pre-commit`: To active pre-commit hooks, including `black`.
- `pytest`: To test the project.
- `rich-click`: To handle the CLI beautifully.
